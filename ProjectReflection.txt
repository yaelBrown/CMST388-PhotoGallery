  Project Reflection:
    Answer the following questions when you submit your assignments files.
      a. What is the theme of your design?
        The theme is a photogallery of Formula 1 Driver Lewis Hamilton. They are random pictures.

      b. Where did you find your photos (include URL if image was downloaded from the Internet)?
        Google Images searching for Lewis Hamilton, changing the image size in the settings to Large.
        URL: https://www.google.com/search?q=Lewis+Hamilton&tbm=isch&source=lnt&tbs=isz:l&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiowPmZl8riAhVGw1kKHcrFBcYQpwUIIw&biw=971&bih=690&dpr=1

      c. What modifications did you make to the images (describe what you did to complete the assignment)?
        I resized the images to 800x400 in photoshop.

      d. What issues or challenges did you face completing this project?
        Challenges I faced with was how to use the id selectors, add/remove class, and write switch statement. I have not used those techniques in awhile so I had to google and use w3schools as a refresher.
